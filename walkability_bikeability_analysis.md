The participants were asked questions such as “Is traffic heavy in your neighborhood?”; “Do you feel safe walking during the day and at night in your neighborhood?”; “Does your neighborhood provide facilities for people to be physically active (walking, biking)?” and “Are there many opportunities to practice physical activities or sports in clubs, gyms or other spaces in your neighborhood?”.

## participatory mapping sessions\n\nTrained Community Coalition and PARC mapping facilitators and South Los Angeles residents convened at a local community center in March 2015 to map 1) resident walking routes to Helen Keller Park and 2) neighborhood characteristics (eg, streetlights, crime) associated with park access. This information would then be scaled up to 3) examine place-based determinants of health across South Los Angeles, and based on these results, 4) develop grassroots solutions for improving recreational access.\n\nTo achieve mapping objectives, as a collective group, residents were briefed on mapping procedures and informed that they could stop participating at any time. Participants then joined 1 of 4 contemporaneous, 1-hour mapping sessions, each with 8 to 12 participants. Two mapping sessions were organized according to resident location to account for geographic differences in resident experiences, a third session accommodated Spanish-language speakers, and a fourth session included community adolescents aged 15 to 18. In addition, public health officials and gang interventionists, who also possessed knowledge of the area, aided in session facilitation.\n\nFacilitators began each session by reviewing mapping objectives. Participants were then geographically oriented to recognizable neighborhood institutions on the 4-by-5-foot paper street maps (Figure 1) to confirm participant map awareness. Following this step, participants were asked to identify their walking and public transportation routes to Helen Keller Park and neighborhood assets (eg, streetlights) and challenges (eg, crime) that may encourage or encumber resident mobility. Mapping facilitators traced resident mobility routes, marking assets and challenges along each route. Notes were also recorded on paper to capture resident concerns that could not be mapped. Then, participants reconvened into the collective group to review overarching themes and provide an opportunity for participants to add any additional points missed during breakout sessions. Participants were offered dinner after the event.

Three items were potentially relevant to walking: (1) It is pleasant to walk in my neighborhood, (2) In my neighborhood, it is easy to walk to places, and (3) I feel safe walking in my neighborhood day or night. The categories of neither agree nor disagree, disagree, and strongly disagree were combined as neutral/negative because of their small sizes.

Based on the framework of Pikora and colleagues19 we assessed four domains of objective area characteristics, ie design (cycling paths/lanes, streets, street width, alternative routes), safety (lighting, traffic control), destination features (bike parking facilities and destinations such as education institutions, shops (all types), post offices, sport facilities and public transport stops/stations) and aesthetics (streetscape, views, maintenance).
